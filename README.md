# SS14-Advanced-Paperwork
This is a collection of a more complex form system, inspired and built off of the forms provided by Moomoobeef. If you have any suggestions or optimizations feel free to reach out to me on discord: tyto_theowl
You can find Moomoobeef's original collection here: https://github.com/Moomoobeef/ss14-forms-txt

## Gameplay Intent Behind the Forms
* These forms are meant to improve gameplay in a "yes, and" format. Treat these as a DnD Dungeon Master, allowing the player to get what they want, but only by overcoming a fitting challenge.
* That challenge is best posed as a needed stamp, with timeconsuming paperwork as more of a fallback. Use the forms to promote the crew to interact with each other, rather than sit outside the HoP office.
* Embrace the silliness of bureaucracy, with the right forms (AND STAMPS), anyone can do anything with a permit, doesnt matter how illegal the Head of Security claims it to be!
* The aim should be "Yes I DO have a form for that." and with the help of the Lawful Evils among you, we will construct a database where no request feels original. Mwahaha.

## THE BASICS

* The proper way to use these forms is by starting with a Parent Form containing all of the important details, and then adding Child Forms for each action needed in that Parent Form. 
* The Child Forms are not designed for sandbagging anyone but Security, only to add to the physical paperwork handed someone in a folder. They usually only require the crews name to be put on it and the occasional "I agree" checkmark.
* Requests that need a child form but dont have an applicable Parent Form can instead use the Fasttrack form, have a new one written up using the base template, or ignore the Parent Form if you choose.

There are currently 3 types of forms: 
1. PTF = Parent Transfer Form (They tend to be Job related PRF's)
2. PRF = Parent Request Form (This is the form the crew should spend the most time on)
3. CRF = Child Request Form (These are handed out along side a main Parent Form, and have minimal signing required)

## Document Rules and Tips

1. The crew should not have to delete text or have any difficulty finding where to type. Having to remove 'Sample Person' from every form turns formatting into the most frustrating part of the paperwork.
2. If someone brings their own paperwork, remember to "Yes, and." If it has the NT Logo, say something like "Well this is an older form but it's Nanotrasen approved." Dont gatekeep bureaucracy!
3. Stamps are your law, aside from validating them with Commands staff, lawyer up for your crew. If they have the stamps, they have approval. Debate the HoS for some good nerdy friction!
4. As stated in 3, I like to play as if the HoP is the HoS's rival. You are a nonmalicious enabler to crew antics, your goal is to just have it documented with a permit, to the HoS's dismay.
5. The HoP stamp and the Approved stamp are different treat them as such. The HoP stamp makes documents unalterable on their way to be stamped, save the approved stamp for the finished form.

Bonus Tip: Use sealed envelopes or even 'return' envelopes for important documents that you are worried might get tampered with.
